    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <h2>FiscallyFit - Financial Literacy App</h2>
      <p>• Developed as a capstone project during my Computer Science undergraduate program</p>
      <p>• Designed to improve financial literacy by helping users track, visualize, and understand personal spending habits.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>Technologies Used</h3>
      <p>• Flutter: Built a responsive, cross-platform interface for both mobile and web using a single Dart codebase</p>
      <p>• Dart: Used as the main programming language for the UI and business logic</p>
      <p>• Plaid API: Integrated securely to fetch real-time financial data like account balances and transaction history from user-linked bank accounts</p>
      <p>• Redis: Implemented caching to store the most recent API responses, reducing load times and minimizing unnecessary calls to Plaid</p>
      <p>• Google Cloud Platform (GCP): Hosted backend services, enabling cloud scalability, managed infrastructure, and consistent uptime</p>
      <p>• Cloud Functions/Instances: Used for API orchestration, auth token generation, background processing, and secure data handling</p>
      <br>
      <h3>Key Features and Outcomes</h3>
      <p>• Achieved real-time financial data visualization through secure API handling</p>
      <p>• Enabled offline performance optimization by caching frequent data requests</p>
      <p>• Leveraged cloud infrastructure to build a scalable and production-ready app</p>
      <p>• Applied secure authentication and session handling to protect sensitive user data</p>
      <p>• Gained hands-on experience in fullstack development, DevOps, API management, and cloud deployment</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h2>BlueConnect - Bluetooth Multi-Link Manager</h2>
      <p>• Developed a Java/Kotlin-based mobile app that allowed one device to establish and manage simultaneous connections to multiple Bluetooth signals</p>
      <p>• Designed to support use cases such as multi-device pairing for smart environments (e.g., fitness trackers, speakers, IoT sensors)</p>
      <p>• Created as part of a collaborative engineering team, working alongside a dedicated UX Engineering group to refine layout, interactions, and accessibility</p>
      <br>
      <h3>Technologies & Frameworks</h3>
      <p>• Java & Kotlin: Built the Android mobile app natively, leveraging Bluetooth APIs and concurrency tools</p>
      <p>• Android Bluetooth Stack: Used BluetoothAdapter, BluetoothGatt, and BroadcastReceiver to manage connections, signal strength, and data flow</p>
      <p>• Android Jetpack Components: Utilized LiveData, ViewModel, and Room for clean architecture and lifecycle-aware design</p>
      <p>• Material Design Guidelines: Ensured a modern, polished interface through collaboration with the UX team</p>
      <br>
      <h3>Team Collaboration & Process</h3>
      <p>• Worked in a cross-functional agile team: 3 software engineers + 2 UX designers + 1 product manager</p>
      <p>• Participated in design sprints (Scrums), feedback loops, and UI testing sessions to iterate on wireframes and prototypes</p>
      <p>• Practiced Git-based version control and code reviews to maintain team-wide coding standards and efficiency</p>
      <br>
      <h3>Key Features & Outcomes</h3>
      <p>• Enabled multi-device Bluetooth pairing with a clean, user-friendly interface</p>
      <p>• Real-time feedback on connection status, signal strength, and device metadata</p>
      <p>• Focused on low energy optimization to ensure long-term Bluetooth session stability</p>
      <p>• Delivered a fully functional prototype with strong UX principles and technical robustness</p>
      <p>• Gained valuable experience in hardware-level interaction, native Android development, and design-engineering collaboration</p>
